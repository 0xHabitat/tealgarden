## 1. Practice / Process ID

Citizen Assembly Through Sortition and QV


## 2. Category

`Governance`

Size: `Community` `National` `International` `Crowd`

## 3. Summary

Sortition is one of the most ancient and proven democractic principles. It elevates a randomly selected group of people/citizens as informed representives of the mass. 

This process aims to combine the benefits of Quadratic Voting and sortition to give people power for a limited time and only for specific topics. It aims to offer an alternative of the traditional Representive Democracy in the existing political spectrum. People get the chance to exchange ideas with experts and opposed opinion leaders to get a full and gradually more neutral view on the topic.

Sortition believes in the innocence and good intentions of normal citizens that pursue their daily life. Citizens become more aware of their social and economic responsibility as a temporary representitive of the community. 

To start of, this practice can be introduced as an influential balance and new power to existing political structures. 

## 4. Benefits

- limited power for a specific topic over a specific timeframe (power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolute // source: human history/present)
- human focus and purpose driven (long-term values over cold numbers)
- QV as ranking model and minority safeguard
- blockchain and digital solutions making complex sortition based solutions scalable

## 6. Integration Steps / Instructions

### 6.1 "Title of First Step"

Topic definition

#### A. "First Action"

**Defining topics**
First of, one or multipal political or social topics need to be identified and asked. Through pol.is people can register via twitter (**==update to web3.0 needed==**) and simple up or down vote a certain argument. Every votes counts and flows into a general understanding of the users opinion. The arguments are created by the users themselves. The incentive is to create a statement that finds a better consensus among all participants.

#### B. "Second Action"

**AI powered opinion groups**
Let machine learning at pol.is do the trick. Opinion groups are formed automatically and visualize everyones standing in the crowd. This sets the ground for a more representative sortition.

#### C. "Third Sub-Action"

**Adding second dimension with QV**

Every time you vote on a statement you are allowed to do this at a quadratic rate. By giving your most valued statements more votes you enable a ranking of your favorite statements.
Once every statement has been voted on, pol.is creates a list of the most divisive and most consensus statements. It allows to vote on topics that provide more consenus than devision.

### 6.2 "Title of Second Step"

Sortition

#### A. "First Action"

**Randomly choosing representative people of opinions groups**
To attack one of the disadvantages of Sortition - [Misrepresentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition#Misrepresentation) - people are selected as representatives in their oppinion group. This assures a higher probability of assuring a good spectrum of interests and oppinions. ==A sortition integration for pol.is is needed here==

#### B. "Second Action"

**Exchange opinions and world view**
With the help of "[Digital Peace Talks](https://digitalpeacetalks.com/english.html)" chats can be opened to let people of opposite oppinion groups get in touch with each other. They can exchange views anonymously and rank their chat - if both find it positive their oppinion positions are getting alligned closer. ==an integration to pol.is needs to be done==

#### C. "Third Action"

**Exchange of information with experts**
(solving "[Incompetence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition#Incompetence)") To add a wider spectrum of information different oppinion experts and leaders are invited to join the choosen citizen representatives in mandatory video meetings.

After each session the opinions groups are mixed together in team sessions to discuss new insights and take-aways.

The goal of these expert talks and group video/chat iteration cycles is the opportunity for everyone to get the clearest informational insight about the chosen topic.
