## 1. Practice / Process ID

**Teal Video Meetings**


## 2. Category

:date: Meetings

## 3. Summary

Regular & inclusive meetings enable a closer communication of team members and allows governance processes to happen. The governance process of a team is essential and enables further actions to be initiated. Defining, amending, electing & removing roles, circles or policies are all done during a governance meeting. Additional tactical meetings, help circle members to share metrics, progress in projects or handle tensions & ask for help from peers.

With a working meeting architecture, teams avoid intransparent structures & destructive habits. No more meetings behind closed doors. Where hierarchical organizations fail, this process ensures a open & inclusive environment to document progress, achievements & mediate tensions.

The **Secretary** of the group is responsible to schedule meetings & invite other members to enact the governance & tactical processes. A **Facilitator** is guiding through the meeting & ensures all participants stick to the policies.

All other team members are invited via a **calendar tool** of choice. By using a **video-conferencing tool**, partners working from home or remote locations can easily join & interact.

## 4. Benefits
