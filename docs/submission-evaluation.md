# Submission Proposal Evaluation

> **Teal.Garden is a community platform for self-managed & distributed organizations.**

* We are interested to learn how digital tools can amplify the workflows & improve the outcomes for the organization. Teal.Garden is not a collection of installation guides or a marketing platform.

* We want to reach out to communities, organizations & initiatives to see what works on any scale. Experiences and take-aways of smaller teams are valuable as well and will have a place on Teal.Garden.

* For each submission, every observer should be able to clearly answer the following questions with **yes**.



### Essential Questions:

* Does your submission fit our [template](https://hackmd.io/@5-YIdqM_TiWI7n-xRmaUqg/H1ywNR6_I) ?

- Is your submission proposal a self-management process/practise? 
- Do multiple roles or systems interact in the proposal?
- Does the process deliver value to an organization or customer?
- Can each tool in the process be replaced by a opensource alternative?
- What are the interfaces between the process and the organization?



### 

### Go the Extra Mile:
