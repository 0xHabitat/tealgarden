# Submission Proposal Evaluation

Teal.Garden is our community platform for self-managed & distributed teams. When collecting content & insights, we want to avoid tool developers to use teal.garden as a simple marketing platform. Also, teal.garden is not a collection of installation guides.

How do we clarify which practices & processes count as a valid submission to teal.garden?

**Wiki definition of process:**

> “A business process or business method is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks by people or equipment in which a specific sequence produces a service or product (serves a particular business goal) for a particular customer or customers.”

For each submission one should be able to clearly answer the following questions with ==**yes**==.

### Questions:

- Is the submission proposal a process?

- Do multiple roles or systems interact in the proposal?

- Does the process deliver value to an organization or customer?

- Can each tool in the process be replaced by another one?

* What are the interfaces between the process and the organization?
