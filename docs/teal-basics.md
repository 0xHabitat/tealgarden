# Teal Garden Track - Basic Explainers :books:

**Hackers**, welcome to our quick explainers, to give you a conception of what you need to consider building with us at **ETH Turin**.

Don't feel overwhelmed by all the materials, we simply want to give you a little primer to get started more easily :)



## What is a process?

A simple Wikipedia entry can help us understand what a process is:

> “A business process or business method is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks by people or equipment in which a specific sequence produces a service or product (serves a particular business goal) for a particular customer or customers.”

We created an evaluation page to make sure we & you know what a good process is all about:

## What is a adoption requirement ?

While collecting ideas and checking the components, ask yourself the following questions:

- What is essential to perform this process?
- Which prerequisites are needed to adopt this process as practice?



**Examples:**

- "The organization needs to practice holacracy v4.1 or higher"

- "Each team-member needs a web-3 enabled wallet."

  

## What is a Role?

### in context of teal organizations:

The building blocks of teal organizational structure are roles. Teal organizations distinguish between roles and the people who fill them, as one individual can hold multiple roles at any given time.

A role is not a job description; its definition follows a clear format including a name, a purpose, optional "domains" to control, and accountabilities, which are ongoing activities to perform.

Roles are defined by each circle —or team— via a collective governance process, and are updated regularly in order to adapt to the ever-evolving needs of the organization.


#### For every role, there is a purpose, domains & accountabilities:



##### Purpose

The purpose helps to define the identity of a role. It features a sentence or explainer what is the "higher goal" of the person claiming the role. It authorizes the role to take any action necessary to express the purpose, as long as it does not violate the domain of another role.

**Examples:**

* e.g. Facilitator: "Circle governance and operational practices aligned with the Constitution."
  

##### Domain 

A Domain is a "property" of the organization (e.g. asset, function, or process) given to a **role** or circle in order to give it **exclusive control** of that resource.

**Examples:**

- The company's main website
- Event registration process
- Financial transaction processing systems & processes



##### Accountabilities

For every role there are accountabilities connected to each domain. These are ongoing activities expected to be performed by the role to benefit the organization. The Accountabilities grant authority to the role to take any action necessary to perform the activities.

**Examples:**

* updating the companies website when contents are added
* spellchecking blog posts before they are published
* reporting on metrics of specific domain

#### 



## What is a Policy ?

A **Policy** is created by a Circle or Role to grant or limit access over some Domain that it controls. Using Policies, self-managed teams are also able to setup their own system of rewarding & penalizing certain behaviours.

**Here is a example policy:**

> Policy: Password Requirements
> "Anyone using passwords to secure company-related accounts with access to company assets or sensitive data must ensure those passwords are strong, not duplicated on any other system, not stored anywhere except a highly protected repository, and may not share the actual password text with anyone else."

Policies are proposed by the roles which feel a need to implement them. The governance process of holacracy can help enabling these policies for the organization.

-- **Draft a simple policy if it is necessary for your process, make sure to mention it in the instructions.**



## What is holacracy?

**Holacracy** is a new way of structuring and running your organization that replaces the conventional management hierarchy. Instead of operating top-down, power is distributed throughout the organization – giving individuals and teams freedom while staying aligned to the organization’s purpose.

**Holacracy-powered organizations** focus on purpose at every level of scale: organizational purpose, team purpose, and individual purpose are all explicit and aligned. Every team member directs their energy in alignment with the broader mission, unlocking your organization’s full potential.

Since Holacracy emerged, organizations adapted and changed the concept to their structure. The [Holacracy Constitution](https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art1) is the first touch point with Holcracy for most self-managed teams.



## What is a Teal Organization?

Characterized by **self-management, wholeness, and a deeper sense of purpose**, these organizations – which are described as **“Teal”** – operate largely without organization charts, management hierarchies, quarterly goals or other traditional management strategies.

Instead, they’re characterized by features like **self-managed teams**, intuitive reasoning and **decentralized decision-making**. Because these practices are so new, the conversation around what they are and how to implement them is **ongoing**.

## :tada: Bonus:

**Whats up with these colors ?**

**Frederic Laloux’s** acclaimed book **_"Reinventing Organizations"_** describes how every time humanity shifts to a new stage of evolution it also achieves a radically more productive organisational model.

**Organisational Categories**
Laloux’s research consolidates and builds upon previous work, setting it all within a framework that is easier to understand. Each paradigm shift in organisation is identified and categorised with the ones we see today being shown in the following table:
