## Future of organization

Non-hierachical organisations are the future for distributed self-managed people. Already today many organisations coordinate themselves decentralized and as a collaboration of members inside a community. 

Transparency of processes (e.g. communication, decision making and task management) are the key for better influence and responsive action. The members of the group are drivers of the organisation allows it to flourish.
