# SolarPunch :muscle: :sunny:

A collection of self-management processes and tools used by communities, DAOs and collaboratives around the globe.

## The Community

We host a community of curated internal organisational processes and the independent tools that are used. The SolarPunch members range from smaller teams over intermediate initiatives to bigger international movements.

**Learn**  
Test and integrate new solutions from the community. Learn about new processes, decentralized mangement methods and open-source tools.   

**Experiment**  
Become the owner of your data and documents by using decentralized or self-hosted tools. Inform yourself about sovereign tech and find the right organisational solution with the right tool.  

**Share**  
Become a organisation architect and share your individual experience of organising yourself or your initiative. 

We believe in open-source and decentralized software solutions that keeps privacy and the sovereignity of the user. As solarpunks we believe in open software for decentralized communities of the people. 

Become part of the solarpunch community - learn, experiment, share. 

## Join the Future of Organization

Non-hierachical organisations are the future for distributed self-managed people. Already today many organisations coordinate themselves decentralized and as a collaboration of members inside a community. 

Transparency of processes (e.g. communication, decision making and task management) are the key for efficient organisation. Members are the drivers of change with responsive and influential actions.
