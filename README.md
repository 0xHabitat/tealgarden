# Teal.Garden Track :seedling: :sunny: - Join the Future of Organizations

##### Sustainable Development Goals:

:chart_with_upwards_trend:`SDG 8: Decent Work & Economic Growth`  
:milky_way: `SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure`  
:house_with_garden: `SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities`  
:handshake: `SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals`  



The current health and economic crises have created vast & sudden change. Now it is up to us to rebuild communities and organizations. Let's take the chance and create the better world our hearts know is possible.

Instead of hierarchies that dictate our actions, or economic machineries that force financial rationale over social and ecological wellbeing, we can create work environments where we can bring ourselves as a whole, and collaborate with peers to realize a purpose that we care for deeply.

## :question: Questions:

* Which processes and tools have enabled people in your community or workspace to coordinate without a central power of authority?
* Which practices and processes can you imagine that will bring out the best of your collective organization in the future?



## :heavy_check_mark: Scope:

:point_right: **First Step:**
* Get comfortable with teal practices & holacracy, take some time and see our resources & explainers:

    * [Basic Explainers](https://github.com/deora-earth/tealgarden/blob/develop/docs/teal-basics.md)



:point_right: **Second Step:**

* We have created a template to easily share your practices with the world. Please have a look before you continue:

    * [Submission Template](https://hackmd.io/@5-YIdqM_TiWI7n-xRmaUqg/H1ywNR6_I)

* We already pre-filled examples for a better understanding:

    * [Submission Folder](https://github.com/deora-earth/tealgarden/tree/develop/submissions)

* To better give you an insight about what we are looking for have a look at our evaluation paper:

    * [Evaluation Criteria](https://github.com/deora-earth/tealgarden/blob/develop/docs/submission-evaluation.md)



:point_right: **Third Step:**  

Now that you have a feeling for the matter, let's build:


**1.** Think about an organisational challenge in your community, your crew or even on an international scale. 

* Maybe you already have experience in self-management and want to share your best practices that worked!
  

**2.** Connect several free, open-source or web3 tools. Define the different to-dos in each step and give some important insights within the practice of your choice.

**3.** Copy this empty [template.md](https://github.com/deora-earth/tealgarden/blob/develop/docs/start_here_blank_template.md) file and hold onto our [template explainer](https://hackmd.io/@5-YIdqM_TiWI7n-xRmaUqg/H1ywNR6_I).

**4.** Fill everything and maybe even give us important feedback.

**5.** Upload your finished .md file via a GitHub pull request to our teal.garden repo and [submission folder](https://github.com/deora-earth/tealgarden/tree/develop/submissions).  Put the name of your **team** and the title of the **process** as a name for the file.

:point_right: -  :tada: **Congratulations**, you've just created your first own teal practice! :tada:


**Instead of submitting a single process/practise, feel free to submit multiple ones!**
