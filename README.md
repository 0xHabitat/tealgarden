# Teal.Garden Track :seedling: :sunny: - Join the Future of Organizations

##### Sustainable Development Goals:

:chart_with_upwards_trend:`SDG 8: Decent Work & Economic Growth`
:milky_way: `SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure` 
:house_with_garden: `SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities`
:handshake: `SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals`

The current health and economic crisis have created vast & sudden change. Now it is up to us to rebuild communities and organizations. Let's take the chance and create the future we want.

Instead of hierarchies that dictate our actions, or economic machineries that force financial rationale over social and ecological wellbeing, we can create work environments where we can bring ourselves as a whole, and collaborate with peers to realize a purpose that we care for deeply.

## :question: Questions:

* Which processes and tools have enabled people in your community or workspace to show up as a whole?

* Which practices and processes can you imagine that will bring out the best of your organization in the future?

## :heavy_check_mark: Scope:

:point_right: **First Step:**
* Get comfortable with teal practices & holacracy, take some time and see our resources & explainers:

    * [Basic Explainers](https://hackmd.io/R0EIa_W1QZ2xVa0tSJqk6Q?view)

:point_right: **Second Step:**

* We have created a .json schema file to capture organizational practices and tools that are aligned with the SDG goals.

    * [processSchema.json](https://github.com/deora-earth/tealgarden/blob/develop/processSchema.json)

* Check our examples & the evaluation to match the criterias of our track:

    * [Our Examples](https://github.com/deora-earth/tealgarden/tree/develop/packages/common/src/data/processes)
    * [Proposal Evaluation](https://hackmd.io/dMlEYrGOTIm8Yw4e50V8qA?view)

* Not sure how to build the .json ? We have a validator for you:
    * [www.jsonschemavalidator.net](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/)

:point_right: **Third Step:**  

Now that you have a feeling for the matter, let's build:

1. Connect several free, open-source or web3 tools to support the practice of your choice.

2. Use our .json template, fill out all fields, document all steps & requirements.
	* :tada: **Congratulations**, you just created your first own teal practice! :tada:


:point_right: **Final Steps:**
1. Once you are finished, create a pull request in our repo.

2. We will check all submissions and merge the content to our [teal.garden](https://teal.garden) page. 

3. You can also check all other submissions over there.
