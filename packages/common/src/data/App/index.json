They are announced via the official communication channels for objections, clarification or support. \r\n\r\nThey incentivize creative bounty creators (bounty gardener) and motivated bounty hunters (bounty worker) alike.\r\n\r\nThe given process gives an exemplary insight about the structure, rules and parameters that are used in proven in our organisation.
