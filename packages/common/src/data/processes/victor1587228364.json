    "abstract": "Regular & inclusive meetings enable a closer communication of team members and allows governance processes to happen. The governance process of a team is essential and enables further actions to be initiated. Defining, amending, electing & removing roles, circles or policies are all done during a governance meeting. Additional tactical meetings, help circle members to share metrics, progress in projects or handle tensions & ask for help from peers.\r\n\r\nWith a working meeting architecture, teams avoid intransparent structures & destructive habits. No more meetings behind closed doors. Where hierarchical organizations fail, this process ensures a open & inclusive environment to document progress, achievements & mediate tensions.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the group is responsible to schedule meetings & invite other members to enact the governance & tactical processes. A Facilitator is guiding through the meeting & ensures all participants stick to the policies.\r\n\r\nAll other team members are invited via a calendar tool of choice. By using a video-conferencing tool, partners working from home or remote locations can easily join & interact.",
